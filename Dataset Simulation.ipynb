    "The first thing Zoe had to decide was how often to track her progress. She found that there is a lot of conflicting information online about how often one should weigh themselves when trying to lose weight. Some believe that weighing in too frequently can cause anxiety (https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-you-shouldnt-weigh-yourself-every-single-day/) or discouragement (https://www.medicinenet.com/to_weigh__or_not_to_weighthat_is_the_question/views.htm) as weight fluctuations in the short-term can be quite unpredictable due to factors such as hydration or what was last eaten. However, some studies have shown that higher weighing frequency is associated with greater weight loss, (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1207/s15324796abm3003_5) less weight regain, (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1479-5868-5-54) and is not associated with adverse psychological outcomes like anxiety (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20946). It really comes down to personal preference and what an individual feels works well for them. (https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/how-often-should-you-weigh-yourself/)\n",

BMR can be estimated based on a person's gender age, weight and height.\n",

It is calculated by taking a person's BMR and multiplying it by a number that represents their activity level, ranging from sedentary to athlete.

    "Like many people,  Zoe tends to consume more calories over the weekend than during the week. (https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/avoid-weekend-weight-gain#1) Being aware of this, she tries as best she can to stick closely to the 1500 calorie budget during the week. To reflect this, the sigma value in the *cal_in* function above was set to just 100 calories to keep values close to 1500. At the weekend she can potentially consume between 250-500 calories (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5928328/) over her target calorie amount. When creating the calories_in column below, the days Saturday and Sunday get a random integer between 250-500 added to the value that was generated by the *cal_in* function. "
