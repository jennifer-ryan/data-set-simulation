    "This project simulates a dataset created by a woman - let's call her Zoe - who decided to track her weight loss efforts in a spreadsheet over the course of a calender year from 01/01/18 - 31/12/18. As a new years resolution she decided to begin eating less and exercising more in order to lose weight and be more healthy overall. To set herself up for success, she did a lot of research beforehand and was very fastidious in logging her calorie intake, estimated calorie output and actual weight loss.  \n",

She has a moderately balanced diet (if perhaps a bit overindulgent!), exercises very little, and does not have any known medical issues that would have a direct affect on her weight. Since there are no glaring physical or environmental factors that should hinder her weight loss efforts, she believes that she can start to lose weight by making some slight lifestyle adjustments rather than any drastic changes. Fad diets or dietary supplements that promise quick weight-loss results are difficult to stick to long-term and can potentially be bad for one's health (https://www.indi.ie/fact-sheets/healthy-eating,-healthy-weight-and-dieting/436-the-truth-about-fad-diets-and-dietary-supplements-for-weight-loss.html) so Zoe decides to lower her calorie intake, without changing the type food she eats too much, and adds in a bit of exercise. \n",

    "BMR is a person's estimated energy expenditure over the course of a day when they are at rest.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) In other words, it is the number of calories burned by the body just performing basic functions like breathing or circulating blood. BMR is determined by a person's  weight, height, age and sex. There are many online calculators where a person can input these values to get an approximation of their BMR. Some use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation while others use the Harris-Benedict equation. (https://tdeecalculator.net/ ; https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html#; https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/health/bmr-calculator.php; https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bmr_calculator.htm ) The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is an updated version of the 100 year old Harris-Benedict equation and is considered to be more accurate to modern life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris%E2%80%93Benedict_equation) so Zoe decides to use this equation to calculate her BMR. The formula is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**<center>10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(years) + s</center>**\n",

She aims to lose weight in a slow, sustainable manner in the hopes of losing 12kg over the course of the year. It is often estimated that to lose a pound (0.454kg) of fat, one needs to burn about 3500 calories, (https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/calories/art-20048065) but this should only be taken as a guideline, not a fact as it is, at the very least, an over-simplication.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035446/) However, it serves as a useful starting point for someone looking to estimate their calorie deficit goals and so Zoe works her calculations based on a 3500 calorie deficit being equivalent to 454g weight loss. \n",

To simplify her calculations, she decides to follow the 3500 calorie deficit every fortnight, which should allow her to lose about 0.227g per week. As calculated below, this means she needs to cut her daily calorie intake by about 250 calories below her TDEE and so sets her daily allowance to 1649 calories"

However, some studies have shown that higher weighing frequ0ency is associated with greater weight loss, (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1207/s15324796abm3003_5) less weight regain, (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1479-5868-5-54) and is not associated with adverse psychological outcomes like anxiety (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20946).
