She found that there is a lot of conflicting information online about how often one should weigh themselves when trying to lose weight. Some believe that weighing in too frequently can cause anxiety (https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-you-shouldnt-weigh-yourself-every-single-day/) or discouragement (https://www.medicinenet.com/to_weigh__or_not_to_weighthat_is_the_question/views.htm) as weight fluctuations in the short-term can be quite unpredictable due to factors such as hydration or what was last eaten. However, some studies have shown that higher weighing frequency is associated with greater weight loss, (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1207/s15324796abm3003_5) less weight regain, (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1479-5868-5-54) and is not associated with adverse psychological outcomes like anxiety (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20946).

In other words, it is the number of calories burned by the body just by functioning normally without moving, such as breathing and circulating blood. It can be estimated based on a person's gender age, weight and height. The TDEE then is the number of calories a person should consume to maintain their current weight.
